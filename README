Prereq:
Neo4j uses HTTP Post, Get, Delete & Put methods. Tragically the default http pkg in GO does not include Delete & Put
Unfortunately you must patch in two methods into the default http package on client.go and then recompile it: 

func (c *Client) Delete(url string) (r *Response, err os.Error) {
        var req Request
        req.Method = "DELETE"
        if req.URL, err = ParseURL(url); err != nil {
                return
        }
        return send(&req, c.Transport)
}
func (c *Client) Put(url string, bodyType string, body io.Reader) (r *Response, err os.Error) {
        var req Request
        req.Method = "PUT"
        req.ProtoMajor = 1
        req.ProtoMinor = 1
        req.Close = true
        req.Body = ioutil.NopCloser(body)
        req.Header = Header{
                "Content-Type": {bodyType},
        }
        req.TransferEncoding = []string{"chunked"}

        req.URL, err = ParseURL(url)
        if err != nil {
                return nil, err
        }

        return send(&req, c.Transport)
}

Once you drop these two methods on the end of client.go, from the http dir, run a make && make install

Install:
If you don't have GOROOT in your environment make sure you set it to your base go dir.
for example:
#: export GOROOT=/usr/local/go

to install:
#: cd Neo4j-GO
#: make && make install
